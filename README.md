# Mint A URIToken Collection

Process to mint an URIToken Collection on Xahau Network

# Requisites

The user needs to provide to the process to provide (order as how is asked in the code):

* Declare the number of URITokens you are going to mint.

* Declare the network: Mainnet or Testnet (I always recommend testing the collection on Testnet before minting on Mainnet).

* The seed of the wallet where you want to mint (Don't share it and keep it safe!).

* Declare the price of each URIToken, for example 10 XAH.

* CID of the IPFS collection json files, you have to upload your .json files in the same url, numbered like 1.json , 2.json, 3.json....

* Copy your .json files in the folder /json_files of the project.

* Declare burnable flag. 

* Your wallet must to have enough XAH available to run the process. For each ticket reservation you need 0.2 XAH, to be safe we can use 0.3 as safe value. If you have a 10 NFT/URIToken collection, try to have 10*0.3= 3 XAH as balance available.

# Notes

This is just an example code, I'm sure there are better ways to do this. I'm not a profesional developer and it is just a sample for those who want to play with Xahau Network.
